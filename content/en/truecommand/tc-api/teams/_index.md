## Team Management
These API calls are for managing teams of users and assigning system permissions to a team rather than an individual user. A "team" is basically a way to save system-access permissions to a generic ID and then associate as many user accounts to that team as desired, allows a quick update of team permissions to impact all users simultaneously.
