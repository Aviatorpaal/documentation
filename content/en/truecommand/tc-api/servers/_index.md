# Server Management
These API calls are for managing which FreeNAS/TrueNAS servers are available through the TrueCommand system.
Administrators can see/modify all servers irrespective of the servers/groups listed on thieir particular user account. Their user settings are better utilized as "favorites" for the home-page of the web interface or something similar.
Non-administrators will only be able to view/interact with servers as dictated by the permissions set in their user configuration
