When your storage is configured and ready for use, there are many advanced management [scheduled tasks]({{< relref "/hub/tasks/scheduled/_index.md" >}}) available for backing up your data, including [snapshotting]({{< relref "/hub/tasks/scheduled/snapshot-scheduling/_index.md" >}}), [cloud synchronization]({{< relref "cloudsync.md" >}}), and [ZFS replication]({{< relref "/hub/tasks/scheduled/replication/_index.md" >}}).
