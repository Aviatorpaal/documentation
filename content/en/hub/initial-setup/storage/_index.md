When your storage is configured and ready for use, there are many advanced management [scheduled tasks](/hub/tasks/scheduled/) available for backing up your data, including [snapshotting](/hub/tasks/scheduled/snapshot-scheduling/), [cloud synchronization](/hub/tasks/scheduled/cloudsync/), and [ZFS replication](/hub/tasks/scheduled/replication/).
