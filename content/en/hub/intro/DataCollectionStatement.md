title: "TrueNAS System Data Collection Statement"
weight:
---

TrueNAS collects non-sensitive system data and relays the data to a collector managed by iXsystems.
This system data collection is enabled by default and can be disabled in the web interface under **System > General > Usage collection**.

Non-sensitive system data is used to identify the quality and operational trends in the fleet of TrueNAS systems used by the entire community.
The collected data helps iXsystems identify issues, plan for new features, and determine where to invest resources for future software enhancements.

The protocol for system data collection uses the same TCP ports as HTTPS (*443*) and passes through most firewalls as an outgoing web connection.
If a firewall blocks the data collection or the data collection is disabled, there is no adverse impact to the TrueNAS system.

The non-sensitive system data collected is clearly differentiated from sensitive user data that is explicitly not collected by TrueNAS.
This table describes the differences:
