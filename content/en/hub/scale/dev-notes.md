## System Requirements

- Any x86_64 compatible (Intel or AMD) processor
- 8GB of RAM (More is better)
- 20GB Boot Device


## Nightly Status

Nightly images for TrueNAS SCALE are built every 24 hours, at around 2AM Eastern (EDT/EST) time. Online updates are created every 2 hours and can be used via the UI's online updating page.

ISO's can be downloaded here:

[https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-scale/](https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-scale/ "https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-scale/")


## Current Feature Status

The nightly images are very much a WIP until we get farther along in our development process. They should be suitable for very adventerous users and developers who are not afraid to use the command-line in some instances.


**Fully Functional via the UI:**
- Pool creation
- Pool Management
- SMB Shares
- iSCSI Shares
- AFP Shares
- NFS Shares
- S3 Shares
- AD / LDAP Directory Services
- Online / Offline updating
- Virtual Machines (Using KVM)
- WebDAV
- Monitoring, Alerting and Reporting

**Supported via the CLI (Currently)**
- Docker
- Docker with NVIDIA --gpu passthrough flags
- Gluster
- Wireguard

**TODO**

- Posix NFSv4 ACLs
- Docker UI
- Clustered Datasets API support for TrueCommand
- TrueCommand Clustering UI for SCALE


## Virtual Machines

**PCI Passthrough Devices**

In order to use PCI passthrough devices with VM's, following steps should be followed so that the PCI devices shows up in UI when we want to create a PCI device to be attached to a VM.

1) Identify the PCI device which should be used for passthrough with command `virsh nodedev-list pci`.
2) Once PCI address has been identified, it should be made sure that the host OS is not using the device anywhere i.e pools etc. After ensuring this case, please  execute `virsh nodedev-detach pci_0000_26_00_0` where `pci_0000_26_00_0` is the name of the PCI device.
3) Step (2) will detach the PCI device from the host and it can be used with a VM guest by adding a PCI device in a VM via UI.

The above steps should be performed when there has been at least 1 VM created via UI.
Please ensure that the device an be safely used with the guest as if it's for example part of a CPU and we try to pass it through to the guest, that might result in a crash and the system will only recover after a reboot.

## Containerisation

**Containers / Kubernetes Roadmap**

TrueNAS SCALE has native host support for container workloads. This part of the software is under active development and not at BETA or RELEASE quality. The notes below explain the path and options that are intended.

The goal of TrueNAS SCALE container services is to provide easy-to-use infrastructure for deploying and managing container workloads on either a single node or a cluster of nodes. The container workloads may be simple Docker containers or a set of complex multi-container Pods that have been custom developed. The REST APIs and web UI for using these services are simple and powerful.

In some cases, users have specific container management tools that they would like to continue using. SCALE allows for this with some reasonable flexibility.

The approach with SCALE to solve this problem is three pronged:

* SCALE includes a Kubernetes distribution (K3s) that has been integrated with middleware to provide a simple web UI and REST API for managing containers.  Kubernetes will operate first on a single node (later  as a cluster) and support Docker containers or Kubernetes pods defined by [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh).  This integration will provide an approximation of the Jails and Plugins capability provided by TrueNAS CORE. The initial WebUI for plugins is planned for the 20.12 release.

* SCALE allows Kubernetes to be disabled. The user will then have access to the native container services within Debian. This will include Docker, LXC (Q1 2021) or any other Kubernetes distribution. There will be a CSI (Container Storage Interface) that can couple the container services with the SCALE storage capabilities.  Users would script these capabilities and then use 3rd party tools like Portainer to manage them. This approach can be used on SCALE 20.10 and later.

* SCALE provides very reliable VMs (via KVM)  for guest OSes with  specific container management features. Users can create these VMs with any OS (including Windows, Linux and FreeBSD) with any software stack they wish. These VMs would allow full integration with existing Container management clusters. This is supported on SCALE 20.10 and later.


**Kubernetes Integration Information**

The integration of Kubernetes software and functionality into TrueNAS SCALE is one of the exciting differentiators of TrueNAS SCALE. TrueNAS SCALE provides an integrated software platform (or appliance) which provides storage services, virtualization and container services.  Integration of the software into TrueNAS SCALE intended to provide many benefits:

* Single downloadable image with Kubernetes, OpenZFS and Storage services
* Simpler deployment with reduced user configuration and more unified documentation
* Coordinated “middleware” response with Integrated alerts, logs and statistics
* Single API and common WebUI
* Automated deployment of Docker containers
* Integration with ZFS and scale-out ZFS (gluster) storage
* Combined and tested software updates with minimal disruption
* Community support of a common and integrated software base
* TrueNAS SCALE Software is still fully Open Source

TrueNAS SCALE 20.12 will provide the first web-bassed user-facing implementation of Kubernetes and container services.

The initial implementation of Kubernetes is being done using the [K3S software](https://k3s.io/) from Rancher (recently acquired by SUSE linux). This proven software base provides a lightweight Kubernetes  implementation with support for the API and ability to cluster instances.

TrueNAS SCALE uses [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh) as a package manager to deploy containerized applications into Kubernetes. Helm can package a single Docker containe or a complex set of containers from any other public/private repositories. TrueNAS SCALE uses Helm charts to manage application deployment and the provide the 3rd party Plugin experience of FreeNAS and TrueNAS CORE.

Docker containers can be deployed directly on TrueNAS SCALE. SCALE will automatically create the Helm charts for the Docker container. Users with more complex applications will be able to deploy their own applications using Helm charts that describe Kubernetes pods with multiple containers.

The storage for Kubernetes will be based on ZFS and scale-out ZFS. Scale-out ZFS is a marriage of Gluster and OpenZFS which provides scale-out properties of higher bandwidth, capacity and increased resilience.  

**Configuring Kubernetes**

In order to leverage containers, SCALE is using a single node kubernetes cluster powered by k3s. In order to configure kubernetes, please type the following command:

```
midclt call -job kubernetes.update '{"pool": "pool_name_here"}'
``` 

This will setup kubernetes on the defined pool. For the first time, it may take a few minutes for the k8s cluster to properly initialise itself. Moving on, if you have a pool configured for kubernetes, kubernetes will start automatically on boot.

**Using Kubernetes**

SCALE does not support deploying workloads to kubernetes cluster officially yet, however users interested in using k8s can do so manually via shell. SCALE has helm3 pre-installed, so users can leverage helm to deploy their workloads.

A tip for users is to add following lines to `~/.zshrc`
```
alias kubectl="k3s kubectl"
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

Setting `KUBECONFIG` is required for using helm and the `kubectl` alias helps use `kubectl` directly instead of prefixing it with `k3s` each time.

A word of caution: Support for kubernetes is still considered experimental, so please use it at your own risk. However if you come across any bugs, please feel free to create tickets at https://jira.ixsystems.com.

**Creating Helm Charts**

SCALE today supports the deployment of Helm charts using the `kubectl` command. Support for natively importing docker containers is coming to the SCALE UI later in 2020. In the meantime, it is possible to create a Helm chart from a docker container by following [various tutorials available online](https://opensource.com/article/20/5/helm-charts#:~:text=%20How%20to%20make%20a%20Helm%20chart%20in,%E2%80%9Cmy-cherry-chart%E2%80%9D%20has%20been%20upgraded.%20Happy%20Helming%21%20More%20).
