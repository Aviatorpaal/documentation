TrueCommand allows you to manage all your TrueNAS systems from one location. This multi-system management increases efficiency and simplifes operations.

## Getting Started
After creating the adminstrator account the first time you log into TrueCommand, you can get started with the initial TrueCommand configuration:

1. Configure TrueCommand Settings (described in this article).
2. [Connect your first TrueNAS system]({{< relref "/TCGettingStarted/ConnectingTrueNAS.md" >}}).
3. [Create user accounts]({{< relref "/TCGettingStarted/UserAccounts.md" >}}).
4. Review the [Interface Overview]({{< relref "/TCGettingStarted/InterfaceOverview.md" >}}) article to become familiar with the interface dashboards, toolbars and icons, and navigation.
