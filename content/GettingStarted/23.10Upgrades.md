{{< toc >}}

There are a variety of options for upgrading to SCALE 23.10.

See the [Software Status page](https://www.truenas.com/software-status/) for iXsystems' software version recommendations based on user type.

## Upgrading from the Web Interface

Log in to the SCALE web interface and go to **System Settings > Update**.
The screen shows which update train is active for the install.

{{< truetable >}}
| Train Type | Name | Notes | 
|------------|------|-------|
| Stable Release | TrueNAS-SCALE-Bluefin | |
| Prerelease | TrueNAS-SCALE-Cobia-BETA | Intended for early testing and feature previews. Do not use a prerelease train for production use. |
| Nightly | TrueNAS-SCALE-Cobia-Nightly | These releases are highly experimental and only suitable for adventurous users that are testing new features as they are being developed. |
{{< /truetable >}}

Uploading a <file>.update</file> file and manually updating switches the system between train types.
This is a one-way operation!
Do not change to a prerelease or nightly release unless the system is intended to permanently remain on early versions and is not storing any critical data.

## Upgrading Using an ISO File

## Migrating from CORE to SCALE

{{< hint type=warning >}}
SCALE is a new and maturing software.
CORE systems with High Availability enabled (HA) can not be upgraded to SCALE with HA.

Migrating from CORE to SCALE is not recommended when custom modifications have been made to the system database.
If any such modifications are present in CORE, these must be reverted before attempting a migration to SCALE.
CORE users should always exercise caution and back up their data and system configuration before starting an upgrade.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint type=important >}}
Systems with TrueNAS CORE major version 12.0 or earlier must update to the latest CORE 13.0 release (e.g 13.0-U5) prior to migrating to SCALE.
{{< /hint >}}

When appropriate, a CORE to SCALE migration is performed with an <file>.iso</file> and USB stick and preserves much of your existing CORE configuration.
See [Migrating from CORE]({{< relref "/GettingStarted/Migrate/MigratingFromCORE.md" >}}) for the USB migration process.
