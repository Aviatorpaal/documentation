{{< toc >}}

There are a variety of options for upgrading to SCALE 23.10.
Here are the current "trains" (linear update paths) for updating TrueNAS and some additional notes about TrueNAS migrations.

{{< truetable >}}
| Train Type | Name | Notes | 
|------------|------|-------|
| Stable Release | TrueNAS-SCALE-Bluefin | |
| Prerelease | TrueNAS-SCALE-Cobia | |
| Nightly | TrueNAS-SCALE-Cobia-Nightly | |
{{< /truetable >}}

{{< hint type=danger title="Upgrading to a Nightly Image" >}}
TrueNAS offers "nightly" images which allow adventurous users and developers to participate in early testing and feedback of future versions of TrueNAS.
These images should not be used in production, and users are required to roll back to a previous "released" version before upgrading again to a stable release.

## Migrating from CORE to SCALE

{{< hint type=warning >}}
SCALE is a new and maturing software.
CORE systems with High Availability enabled (HA) can not be upgraded to SCALE with HA.

Migrating from CORE to SCALE is not recommended when custom modifications have been made to the system database.
If any such modifications are present in CORE, these must be reverted before attempting a migration to SCALE.
CORE users should always exercise caution and back up their data and system configuration before starting an upgrade.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint type=important >}}
Systems with TrueNAS CORE major version 12.0 or earlier must update to the latest CORE 13.0 release (e.g 13.0-U5) prior to migrating to SCALE.
{{< /hint >}}

When appropriate, a CORE to SCALE migration is performed with an <file>.iso</file> and USB stick and preserves much of your existing CORE configuration.
See [Migrating from CORE]({{< relref "/GettingStarted/Migrate/MigratingFromCORE.md" >}}) for the USB migration process.
