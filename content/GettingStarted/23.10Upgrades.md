{{< toc >}}

There are a variety of options for upgrading to SCALE 23.10.

{{< include file="/_includes/23.10UpgradeMethods.md" >}}

See the [Software Status page](https://www.truenas.com/software-status/) for iXsystems' software version recommendations based on user type.

## Upgrading from the Web Interface

Log in to the SCALE web interface and go to **System Settings > Update**.
The **Update Screen** displays the current active update train. For more information on other available trains, see [Release Schedules](https://www.truenas.com/docs/truenasupgrades/).

When a new maintenance version is available from the current train, TrueNAS SCALE stages available updates.
Click **Apply Pending Update** to install it.

{{< include file="/_includes/UpgradeClearCache.md" >}}

Alternately, upload an <file>.update</file> file and perform a manual update.
{{< expand "Manual Update Process (Click to expand)" "v" >}}
{{< include file="/content/_includes/ManualUpdates.md" >}}
{{< /expand >}}

Uploading an <file>.update</file> file from another train and manually updating switches the system between train types.
Changing trains is a one-way operation!
Do not change to a prerelease or nightly release unless the system is intended to permanently remain on early versions and is not storing any critical data.

## Migrating from CORE to SCALE

{{< hint type=warning >}}
SCALE is a new and maturing software.
CORE systems with High Availability enabled (HA) can not be upgraded to SCALE with HA.

Migrating from CORE to SCALE is not recommended when custom modifications have been made to the system database.
If any such modifications are present in CORE, these must be reverted before attempting a migration to SCALE.
CORE users should always exercise caution and [back up their data]({{< relref "/SCALETutorials/DataProtection/_index.md" >}}) and [system configuration]({{< relref "ManageSysConfigSCALE.md" >}}) before starting an upgrade.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint type=important >}}
Systems with TrueNAS CORE major version 12.0 or earlier must update to the latest CORE 13.0 release (e.g. 13.0-U5) prior to migrating to SCALE.
{{< /hint >}}

When appropriate, a CORE to SCALE migration is performed with an <file>.iso</file> and USB stick and preserves much of your existing CORE configuration.
See [Migrating from CORE]({{< relref "/GettingStarted/Migrate/MigratingFromCORE.md" >}}) for the USB migration process.
