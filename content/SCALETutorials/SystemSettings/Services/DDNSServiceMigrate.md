This article provides instructions on how to move from using the deprecated dynamic DNS service to the new **ddns-updater** application. 

The ddns-updater application is a lightweight universal dynanmic DNS (DDNS) updater with web UI. 
When installed, a container launches with root privileges in order to apply the correct permissions to the ddns-updater directories. 
Afterwards, the containter runs as a non-root user.

## Before You Begin
Before you configure the new ddns-updater application:

* Disable the Dynamic DNS service.
  Go to **System Settings > Services**, disable the service, and clear the **Start Automatically** checkbox. 
  This prevents the service from re-enabling after a system restart.

* Review your Dynamic DNS service settings and note all provider, domain, IP address, port number, URL, and credential (username and password) settings.

If establishing a new provider, create the user account before proceeding. Otherwise, use the existing provider details.

If you want to grant access to a specific user (and group) other than using the defaults, add the new non-root administrative user and take note of the UID and GID for this user.

## Migrating from TrueNAS Dynamic DNS Service

After disabling the dynamamic DNS service, install the ddns-updater application. Go to **Apps**, click on **Available Applications**, and locate the **ddns-updater** application widget.

Click **Install** to open the **ddns-updater** configuration wizard.

Select the timezone that applies to your server location from the **Timezone** dropdown list.

Click **Add** to the right of **DNS Provider Configuration** to display provider setting options. 
Select the DDNS provider from the **Provider** dropdown list. 
Each provider displays the settings required to establish a connection with and authenticate to that provider.

{{< hint type=info >}}
The SCALE service dynamic DNS list includes providers not on the ddns-Updater application list. 
If the service configuration uses a service not in the application, create a new account with a provider on the list in the ddns-updater application.

The update period default for the SCALE service is different from the application. Accept the default settings.

To use a notification service, enter the service in **Shoutrrr Addresses**. 
Shoutrrr addresses are a way to make sending notifications easy by standardizing them. 
Enter the [shoutrrr gopher notification service(s) addresses](https://containrrr.dev/shoutrrr/0.7/services/overview/) and separate each entry with a comma.

Enter either the IPv4 or IPv6 HTTP public provider and then the public IP fetcher type you want to use to obtain the public IP address, or select **All providers** in each field.

Select **Host Network** to bind to the host network, but we recommend leaving this disabled.

Select the **DDNS Updater Data Storage** option from the **Type** dropdown list. Options are the iXVolume or host path.

Click **Save**.
