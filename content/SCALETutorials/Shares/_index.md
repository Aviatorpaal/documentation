File sharing is one of the primary benefits of a NAS. TrueNAS helps foster collaboration between users through network shares.  
TrueNAS SCALE allows users to create and configure block (iSCSI) shares targets, Windows SMB shares, Unix (NFS) shares, and WebDAV shares.

When creating zvols for shares, avoid giving them names with capital letters or spaces since they can cause problems and failures with iSCSI and NFS shares.
