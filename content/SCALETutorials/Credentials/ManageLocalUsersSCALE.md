In TrueNAS, user accounts allow flexibility for accessing shared data.
Typically, administrators create users and assign them to [groups]({{< relref "ManageLocalGroups.md" >}}).
Doing so makes tuning permissions for large numbers of users more efficient.

{{< include file="/_includes/RootToAdminUserAccount.md" >}}

When the network uses a directory service, import the existing account information using the instructions in [Directory Services]({{< relref "/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/DirectoryServices/_index.md" >}}).

Using [Active Directory]({{< relref "/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/DirectoryServices/_index.md" >}}) requires setting Windows user passwords in Windows.

To see user accounts, go to **Credentials > Local Users**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/23.10/AllUsersScreenSCALE.png" alt="Local User non-Built-in Accounts" id="Local User non-Built-in Accounts" >}}

TrueNAS hides all built-in users (except root) by default. Click the toggle **Show Built-In Users** to see all built-in users.

## Creating an Admin User Account
SCALE has implemented rootless log in. 
All CORE systems migrating to SCALE, and all Anglefish and early Bluefin releases of SCALE upgrading to 22.12.3 or higher or to Cobia should create and begin using an admin user instead of the root user. 
After upgrading to a SCALE 22.12.3 or Cobia release use this proecudre to create an admin user.

Go to **Credentials > Local Users** and click **Add**.

Enter the name to use for the administrator account. For example, *admin*. 
You can create multiple admin users with any name and assign each different administration privileges.

Enter and confirm the admin user password.

Select **builtin_administrators** ,**root** and **builtin_users** on the **Auxiliary Group** dropdown list.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/23.10/AddAuxillaryGroupAdminUserSettings.png" alt="Add Admin User Auxilliary Groups" id="Add Admin User Auxilliary Groups" >}}

Add the home directory for the new admin user. 
Enter or browse to select the location where SCALE creates the home directory. For example, */mnt/tank*. If you created a dataset to use for home directories, select that dataset.
Select the **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** permissions for **User**, **Group** and **Other** this user should have, then select **Create Home Directory**.

Select the shell for this admin user from the **Shell** dropdown list. To have **System Settings > Shell** open in the SCALE CLI, select **TrueNAS CLI**.

Select the sudo authorization permissions for this admin user. 
Some applications, such as [Nextcloud]({{< relref "InstallNextCloudMedia.md" >}}), require sudo permissions for the administrator account.
For administrator accounts generated during the initial installation process, TrueNAS SCALE sets authorization to **Allow all sudo commands**.

Click **Save**.

Log out of the TrueNAS system and then log back in using the admin user credentials to verify that the admin user credentials work properly with your network configuration.

After adding the admin user account, disable the root user password:

Go to **Credentials > Local Users**, click on the **root** user and select **Edit**.
Click the **Disable Password** toggle to disable the password, then click **Save**.

## Creating User Accounts

When creating a user, you must:

1. Enter a **Full Name** or description for the user, such as a first and last name.
2. Enter a **Username** or accept the generated user name.
3. Enter and enable a **Password**.
4. Specify or accept the default user ID (**UID**)
5. Select the **Shell** option the user has access to when they go to **System Settings > Shell**

All other settings are optional.
Click **Save** after configuring the user settings to add the user.

### Configuring a User
To create a new user, click **Add**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/23.10/AddUserIdentificationSettings.png" alt="Add User Identification Settings" id="Add User Identification Settings" >}}

Enter a personal name or description in **Full Name**, for example *John Doe* or *WebDAV Anonymous User*, then either allow TrueNAS to suggest a simplified name derived from the **Full Name** or enter a name in **Username**.

Enter and confirm a password for the user. 
Click the **Disable Password** toggle to enable the login password.  
Setting the **Disable Password** toggle to active (blue toggle) disables these functions:
* The **Password** field becomes unavailable and TrueNAS removes any existing password from the account.
* The **Lock User** option disappears.
* The account is restricted from password-based logins for services like SMB shares and SSH sessions.

You can assign a user account email address in the **Email** field.

Accept the default user ID or enter a new UID.
TrueNAS suggests a user ID starting at **3000**, but you can change it if you wish.
We recommend using an ID  of 3000 or greater for non-built-in users.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/23.10/AddUser-UserIDAndGroupSettings.png" alt="Add User ID and Groups Settings" id="Add User ID and Groups Settings" >}}

Leave **Create New Primary Group** toggle enabled to allow TrueNAS to create a new primary group with the same name as the user. 
To add the user to a different existing primary group, disable the **Create New Primary Group** toggle and search for a group in the **Primary Group** field.
To add the user to more groups use the **Auxiliary Groups** dropdown list.

Configure a home directory and permissions for the user. Some functions, such as replication tasks, require setting a home directory for the user configuring the task.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/23.10/AddUserHomeDirPermSCALE.png" alt="Add User Home Directory" id="Add User Home Directory" >}}

When creating a user, the home directory path is set to <file>/nonexistent</file>, which does not create a home directory for the user.
To add a home directory, enter or browse to a path in **Home Directory**, then select **Create Home Directory**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/23.10/AddUserHomeDirAuthSCALE.png" alt="Add User Home Directory and Authentication Settings" id="Add User Home Directory and Authentication Settings" >}}

Select **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** for each role (**User**, **Group**, and **Other**) to set access control for the user home directory. 
Built-in users are read-only and can not modify these settings.

Assign a public SSH key to a user for key-based authentication by entering or pasting the public key into the **Authorized Keys** field.
You can click **Choose File** under **Upload SSH Key** and browse to the location of an SSH key file.

{{< hint type=important >}}
Do *not* paste the private key.
{{< /hint >}}

If using an SSH public key, always keep a backup of the key.

Select the [shell]({{< relref "LocalUsersScreensSCALE.md" >}}) option for the user from the **Shell** dropdown list.
Options are **nologin**, **bash**, **rbash**, **dash**, **sh**, **tmux**, and **zsh**.
For members of the **builtin_administrators** group, select **TrueNAS CLI** to open the **Shell** screen in the TrueNAS CLI, or select **TrueNAS Console** to open in the Console Setup Menu for SCALE.

To disables all password-based functionality for the account, selecting **Lock User**. Clear to unlock the user. 

Set the sudo permissions you want to assign this user. 
Exercise caution when allowing sudo commands, especially without password prompts.
We recommend limiting this privilege to trusted users and specific commands to minimize security risks.

**Allowed sudo commands**, **Allow all sudo commands**, **Allowed sudo commands with no password** and **Allow all sudo commands with no password** grant the account limited root-like permissions using the [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/) command. 
If selecting **Allowed sudo commands** or **Allowed sudo commands with no password**, enter the specific sudo commands allowed for this user. 
Enter each command as an absolute path to the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) executable file, for example */usr/bin/nano*.
<file>/usr/bin/</file> is the default location for commands.
Select **Allow all sudo commands** or **Allow all sudo commands with no password**.

Leave **Samba Authentication** selected to allow using the account credentials to access data shared with [SMB]({{< relref "/SCALEUIReference/Shares/_index.md" >}}).

Click **Save**.

## Editing User Accounts

To edit an existing user account, go to **Credentials > Local Users**. 
Click anywhere on the user row to expand the user entry, then click **Edit** to open the **Edit User** configuration screen. 
See [Local User Screens]({{< relref "LocalUsersScreensScale.md" >}}) for details on all settings.
