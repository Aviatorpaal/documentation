TrueCommand allows users to manage all of their systems on a single dashboard that also lets users view single systems at a time.

To manage a single system, either click on the name on a System card or click on the **All** dropdown <span class="material-icons">arrow_drop_down</span> on the left side of the system header at the top of main dashboard. Select or hover over **Ungrouped** to see the list of systems.  
Select the system you want to manage.

Single system cards display various statistics like CPU, memory, disk, network, and storage usage, as well as existing datasets and [alerts]({{< relref "AlertManage.md" >}}).

Users can create and manage storage, replication, snapshots, and shares using the **Explore** button.

Users can view expanded TrueNAS information details by clicking on the double arrows <span class="material-icons">keyboard_double_arrow_down</span> at the lower right corner of the system card.
Information includes the system manufacturer, serial numbers, support tier, support expiration date, host name, CPU, CPU cores, physical memory, OS, and uptime.

Users with adequate permissions can update the system, [configure backups]({{< relref "TrueNASConfigManage.md" >}}), and generate system audits and [reports]({{< relref "/TrueCommand/UserGuide/Reports/Creation.md" >}}). If a system update is available, the **Update** label and icon turn green. You can also see which systems have updates pending on the **Systems** screen.
