When accessing the interface for the first time, you need to create an admin account.

Enter a username and password. These are both case-sensitive.
Read the Terms of Service, select **I have read and agree to the terms of service**, and click **SIGN UP**.

TrueCommand creates the admin login credentials and displays the login page.
