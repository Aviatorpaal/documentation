TrueCommand can be installed or deployed in a variety of environments!
TueCommand Cloud is a Software as a Service (SaaS) option that uses encrypted connections to allow managing TrueNAS 12.0 or newer systems using the Cloud.
To install TrueCommand on a local system, the primary method is to deploy the TrueCommand Docker Container.
You can also install TrueCommand in a Virtual Machine (VM).

Now that TrueCommand is installed, it's time to configure TrueCommand for wider use.
Begin by connecting your TrueNAS systems and verifying your system settings, then import or create the user accounts and teams that need access to the different systems.
From here, the administrator or other user accounts can monitor systems, create reports, and respond to alerts as needed.
TrueCommand administrators can also monitor the user activity on TrueCommand or connected systems.
