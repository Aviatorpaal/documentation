## Directory_Service Commands

The **directory_service** namespace has two commands and four child namespaces and is based on functions found in the SCALE API and web UI. 
It provides access to directory service methods. 
The four child namespaces have their own commands.

You can enter commands from the main CLI prompt or from the **directory_service** namespace prompt.

### Cache_Refresh Command

The `cache_refresh` command refreshes the directory services cache for users and groups. 
The <code>[user query]({{< relref "/SCALECLIReference/Account/_index.md" >}})</code> and <code>[group query]({{< relref "/SCALECLIReference/Account/_index.md" >}})</code> commands use this cache. 
The first cache file in an Active Directory domain might take a significant amount of time to complete, so it is performed within a job. 
Refresh the cache after adding new users or groups to a remote directory server to have the users or groups appear in the results.
A cache refresh is not required to use newly-added users and groups for permissions and ACL related methods. 
It also does not resolve issues with users that cannot authenticate to shares.

#### Description
The `cache_refresh` command displays the status of the cache-refresh process in percentage complete.
This command does not require entering properties or arguments.
Enter the command, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
The `cache_refresh` command returns the status of the refresh in percentage complete.

#### Usage
From the CLI prompt, enter:

`directory_service cache_refresh`

{{< expand "Command Example" "v" >}}
```
directory_service cache_refresh
[0%] ...
[100%] ...
```

### Get_State Command

The `get_state` command displays the current status of the directory service. 

{{< expand "Using Get_State" "v" >}}
#### Description
The `get_state` command returns the state of the Active Directory and LDAP directory services.
The command does not require entering properties or arguments.
Enter the command, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
The command returns a table with the state of both the Active Directory and LDAP services as one of the five possible states in the table below.  

Possible states:
{{< truetable >}}
| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `DISABLED` | Indicates directory service is disabled. |
| `FAULTED` | Indicates directory service is enabled, but not HEALTHY. Review logs and generated alert messages to debug the issue causing the faulted service state. |
| `LEAVING` | Indicates the directory service is in the process of stopping. |
| `JOINING` | Indicates the directory service is in the process of starting. |
| `HEALTHY` | Indicates the directory service is enabled, and the last status check passed. |
{{< /truetable >}}

#### Usage
From the CLI prompt, enter:

`directory_service get_state`

{{< expand "Command Example" "v" >}}
```
directory_service get_state
+-----------------+----------+
| activedirectory | DISABLED |
|            ldap | DISABLED |
