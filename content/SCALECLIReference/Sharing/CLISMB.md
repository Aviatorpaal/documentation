## SMB Namespace
The **smb** namespace has eight command(s), and is based on share creation and management functions found in the SCALE API and web UI.
It provides access to SMB share methods through the **smb** commands.

## SMB Commands
The following **smb** commands allow you to create new shares, manage existing shares, and get information on SMB shares on the system.

You can enter commands from the main CLI prompt or from the **sharing** namespace prompt.
