In general, a [bridge](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6325) refers to various methods of combining (aggregating) multiple network connections into a single aggregate network.
TrueNAS uses [bridge(4)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?bridge(4)) as the kernel bridge driver. 
[Bridge(8)](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/bridge) is a command for configuring the kernal bridge in Linux. 
While the examples focus on the deprecated brctl(8) from the bridge-utilities package, we use ip(8) and bridge(8) from iproute2 instead. Refer to the FAQ section that covers bridging topics more generally.
