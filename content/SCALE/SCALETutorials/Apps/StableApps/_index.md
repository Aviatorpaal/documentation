The **stable** train populates the application catalog with the official applications.
The **Discover** screen shows the **stable** train applications by default.

Applications in the **stable** catalog are added and maintained by iXsystems, and are intended to expand system functionality far beyond what is typically expected from a NAS.
Some apps replace deprecated services or functionality previously built into SCALE.
