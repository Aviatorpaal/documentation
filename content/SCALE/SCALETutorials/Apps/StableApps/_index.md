The **stable** catalog includes official applications for use in SCALE found in the /charts repository in GitHub.
This catalog populates the **Discover** screen by default.

The applications in the **stable** catalog are intended to expand system functionality far beyond what is typically expected from a NAS.

The tutorials in this section for commonly-used **stable** catalog apps are created and maintained by iXsystems.

Some apps replace services or functionality previously built into SCALE but that are now deprecated.
