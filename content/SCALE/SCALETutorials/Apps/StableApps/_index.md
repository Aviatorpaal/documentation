The **Charts** catalog includes official applications for use in SCALE.
This catalog populates the **Discover** screen by default.

The applications in the **Chart** catalog are intended to expand system functionality far beyond what is typically expected from a NAS.

The tutorials in this section for commonly-used **Chart** catalog apps are created and maintained by iXsystems.

Some apps replace services or functionality previously built into SCALE but that are now deprecated.
