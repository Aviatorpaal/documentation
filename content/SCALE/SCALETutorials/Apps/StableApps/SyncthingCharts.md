{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/SyncthingChartsDetailsScreen.png" alt="Syncthing Charts Details Screen" id="Syncthing Charts Details Screen" >}}

Click **Install** to open the **Install Syncthing** screen.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/InstallSyncthingChartsScreen.png" alt="Install Syncthing Screen" id="Install Syncthing Screen" >}}

Accept the default values in **Application Name** and **Version**. 

Accept the default owner user and group ID settings. You can customize your Syncthing charts deployment by adding [environment variables](#configuration-settings) but these are not required.

Add the storage volume(s). 
Either allow the Syncthing app to create the configuration storage volume or use an existing dataset created for this app.
To use an existing dataset, select **Enable Custom Host Path for Syncthing Configuration Volume**, then browse to and select the dataset to populate the field. 
See [Storage Settings](#storage-settings) for more details on adding existing datasets.

Accept the default port numbers in **Networking**. 
See [Network Settings](#networking-settings) below for more information on network settings. 
Before changing the default port number, see [Default Ports](https://www.truenas.com/docs/references/defaultports/) for a list of assigned port numbers.
When selected, **Host Network** binds to the default host settings programmed for Syncthing. We recommend leaving this disabled.

Syncthing does not require advanced DNS options. If you want to add DNS options, see [Advanced DNS Settings](#advanced-dns-settings) below.

Accept the default resource limit values for CPU and memory or select **Enable Pod resource limits** to show the CPU and memory limit fields, then enter the new values you want to use for Syncthing. See [Resource Configuration Settings](#resource-configuration-settings) below for more information.

Click **Install**. 
The system opens the **Installed Applications** screen with the Syncthing app in the **Deploying** state.
After installation completes the status changes to **Running**.

To use existing datasets, select **Enable Custom Host Path for Syncthing Configuration Volume** to show the **Host Path for Syncthing Configuration Volume** and **Extra Host Path Volumes** fields.
Enter the host path in **Host Path for Syncthing Configuration Volume** or browse to and select the dataset an existing dataset created for the configuration storage volume. 

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/InstallSyncthingChartsEnableCustomHostPath.png" alt="Syncthing Enable Host Path Storage fields" id="Syncthing Enable Host Path Storage Fields" >}}
