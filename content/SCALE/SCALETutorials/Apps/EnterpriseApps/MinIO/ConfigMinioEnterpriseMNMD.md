The instructions in this article apply to the TrueNAS MinIO Enterprise application installed in a Multi-Node Multi-Disk (MNMD) multi mode configuration.

For more information on MinIO multi mode configurations see [MinIO Single-Node Multi-Drive (SNMD)](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/operations/install-deploy-manage/deploy-minio-single-node-multi-drive.html) or [Multi-Node Multi-Drive (MNMD)](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/operations/install-deploy-manage/deploy-minio-multi-node-multi-drive.html#minio-mnmd). MinIO recommends using MNMD (distributed) for enterprise-grade performance and scalability.

## Adding MinIO Enterprise App
Community members can add and use the MinIO Enterprise app or the default community version.

## First Steps
Complete these steps for every system (node) in the cluster. 

Assign four sequential IP addresses or host names such as **minio1.*mycompany.com*** through **minio4.*mycompany.com*** to the TrueNAS SCALE system. 
If you assign IP address numbers such as *#.#.#.*100 - 103 or *#.#.#.134 - .137, you can uses these in the command string in the **Multi Mode** field. 
If not using sequential IP addresses, use sequentially numbered host names. 
Add network settings using either the **Network** screen. Enter host names on the **Global Configuration** screen. 

When creating the certificate, enter the system IP addresses for each system in **Subject Alternate Names**. 
If configuring MinIO in a MNMD cluster, enter the system IP addresses for each system in the cluster.

## Installing MinIO Enterprise
{{< hint info >}}
This procedure covers the required Enterprise MinIO App settings.
{{< /hint >}}

Repeat this procedure for every system (node) in the MNND cluster.

{{< include file="/static/includes/MinIOEnterpriseStorageConfig.md" >}}

Select **Enable Multi Mode (SNMD or MNMD)**, then click **Add**. 
If the systems in the cluster have sequentially assigned IP addresses, use the IP addresses in the command string you enter in the **Multi Mode (SNMD or MNMD)** field. 
For example, <b>https://<i>10.123.12.10</i>{0...3}:30000/data{1...4}</b> where the last number in the last octet of IP address number is the first number in the **{0...3}** string. 
Separate the numbers in the curly brackets with three dots. 
If your sequential IP addresses are not using 100 - 103, for example *10.123.12.125* through 128, then enter them as <b>https://<i>10.123.12.12</i>{5...8}:30000/data{1...4}</b>.
Enter the same string in the **Multi Mode (SNMD or MNMD)** field in all four systems in the cluster. 

If you do not have sequentially numbered IP addresses assigned to the four systems, assign sequentially numbered host names. 
For example, **minio1.*mycompany.com*** through **minio4.*mycompany.com***. 
Enter <b>https://minio{1...4}.<i>mycompany.com</i>:30000/data{1...4}</b> in the **Multi Mode (SNMD or MNMD)** field.

### Completing the MinIO Configuration

After installing and getting the MinIO Enterprise application running in SCALE, log into the MinIO web portal and complete the MinIO setup.

Go to **Monitoring > Metrics** to verify the servers match the total number of systems (nodes) you configured. 
Verify the number of drives match the number you configured on each system, four systems each with four drives (4 systems x 4 drives each = 16 drives).

Refer to MinIO documentation for more information.
