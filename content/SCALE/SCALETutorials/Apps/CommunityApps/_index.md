The TrueNAS community creates and maintains numerous applications intended to expand system functionality far beyond what is typically expected from a NAS.

The TrueNAS **Chart** catalog loads as the default catalog to populate the **Discover** screen.
To view or make catalog settings changes, select the **Manage Catalogs** to the right of the search field on the **Discover** apps screen.

Applications are provided "as-is" and can introduce system stability or security issues when installed.

Some applications deploy as the **root** user for initial configuration before changing to operate as a non-root user.
Make sure the application is required for your specific use requirements and does not violate your security policies before installation.

The tutorials in this section are for commonly used community-maintained applications.
Some apps in this section replace deprecated services or functionality previously built into TrueNAS SCALE.
