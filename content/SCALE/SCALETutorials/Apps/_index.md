TrueNAS SCALE can expand beyond its built-in features by installing self-contained applications.
These applications are categorized by specific applications that are supported by the TrueNAS development team, applications (or specific application versions) that are supported by iXsystems in Enterprise-licensed TrueNAS SCALE deployments, and community applications built and supported by the open source TrueNAS community.
Articles in this section cover various deployment and configuration tutorials for these applications.
