SCALE includes the ability to run Docker containers using Kubernetes.

{{< expand "What is Docker?" "v" >}}
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables the separation of applications from infrastructure through OS-level virtualization to deliver software in containers.

{{< expand "What is Kubernetes?" "v" >}}
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management with declarative configuration and automation.

To Set up a Docker Image, first determine if you wish the container to use its own dataset.  Create a dataset before hand if desired. When you are reacy to create a container, click **Launch Docker Image**.

Fill in the *Application Name* and *Image Repository* for the docker contained you'd like to set up.  This example shows installation of the [PiHole project[(https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole).

Click **Next** to move to the *Container Settings* section. In this example, PiHole needs the timezone and password set.   Always refer to the dockerhub page for information on what the docker container requires.

Clicking **Next** will open the Networking section. If the container needs special networking configuration it should be set here.  Ports are configured in the next section.  Once completed, click Next to move forward in the coniguration process.

The PiHole Docker Hub page lists a set of ports that will need to be set.  These values may need to be adjusted depending on the configuration of your system.  TrueNAS SCALE requires all Node Ports to be above 9000.

Click **Next** when all the ports are configured.

The Host Path volume will be set to a dataset and directory paths which were created before attempting to deploy the container.

Additional Volumes can be added to the container if needed.
When all the settings have been entered, verify the Application and Container Name and click **Submit**.

TrueNAS SCALE will deploy the container.

When the deployment is completed the continer will become active.  If the container does not autostart, click the **START** button.

Clicking on the App card will reveal details.

With PiHole as our example we navigate to the IP of our TrueNAS system with the port and directory address `:9080/admin/`.
