The TrueNAS SCALE CLI functions like a text-based version of the web UI with many functional areas grouped into namespaces that mirror the same areas in the SCALE UI, but the underlying CLI structure of namespaces and commands closely follows the SCALE API command, options and arguements documented in the **API Keys > API Docs**.
