## Reporting Namespace
The **reporting** namespace has 3 commands, and is based on system reporting functions found in the SCALE API and web UI.
It provides access to reporting database configuration methods through the **reporting** namespace commands and the child namespaces and their commands.

To view reporting graphs, go to [**Reporting**]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/ReportingScreensSCALE.md" >}}) in the TrueNAS SCALE web UI.

<!-- The get/query related commands do not work in the CLI and are being removed, see: https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-124086 -->

## Reporting Commands
The following **reporting** namespace commands allow you to configure the system reporting database.

You can enter commands from the main CLI prompt or from the **system** namespace prompt.

#### Usage

From the CLI prompt, enter:

<code>system reporting update graph_age=<em>12</em> graph_points=<em>1200</em> confirm_rrd_destroy=true</code>

Where *12* is the maximum age of stored graphs in months and *1200* is the number of points for each graph.
Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

The command returns an empty line.

{{< nest-expand "Command Example" "v" >}}
