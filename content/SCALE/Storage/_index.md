The SCALE Storage topic contains articles on importing, creating, and managing pools, creating and managing snapshots, and importing and managing disks. 

The storage topic also has information about datasets, Zvols, permissions, and quotas.

SCALE supports clustering storage across multiple systems. See [TrueCommand Clustering]({{< relref "/TrueCommand/Clustering/_index.md" >}}) for more details.

Add a screenshot of the Storage page and stronger descriptions of the individual options and their locations.
