The **System Settings > Boot** screen displays a list of boot environments on the TrueNAS system. Each time the system updates to a new software release, it creates a new boot environment.

## Boot Environments

Each boot environment on the list includes:

* **Name** which is the name of the boot entry as it appears in the boot menu.
* **Active** that indicates which entry boots by default if a boot environment is not active. Activated environment displays **Non/Reboot**.
* **Date Created** that shows the creation date and time.
* **Space** shows the boot environment size.
* **Keep** that indicates whether TrueNAS deletes this boot environment when a system update does not have enough space to proceed.

### Batch Operations

Select the checkbox(es) for each boot environment. Displays the **Batch Operations** that allows you to delete the selected environments at one time.
