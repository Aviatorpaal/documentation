The **View Enclosure** screen only displays on TrueNAS SCALE Enterprise systems with compatible hardware.
The UI options to select **System Settings > Enclosure** is not present on incompatible non-Enterprise systems.
{{< /enterprise >}}

The **System Information** widget on the main **Dashboard** displays an image of the specific TrueNAS system. Hover the mouse over the image to see the **View Enclosure** label.
Click anywhere on the system image to open the **View Enclosure** screen.

## View Enclosure Screen
The **View Enclosure** screen displays an image of the TrueNAS platform.
Additional information about storage pools, drives, and other hardware components is available through a variety of clickable elements and buttons.

### Elements Options

The **Elements** button at the top right of the **View Enclosure** screen displays a dropdown list of options to view information about the system or expansion shelf. 
The options vary by TrueNAS platform, if the system is connected to expansion shelves, and if you have an expansion shelf image selected instead of the main system. 
All TrueNAS systems include the **Disks** option. TrueNAS systems with expansion shelves include the **Temperature**, **Power Supply**, and **Voltage** options. 
The expansion shelf  includes the **Disks**, **Cooling**, **Services**, **Power Supply**, **SAS**, **Temperature**, and **Voltage** options. 
Each option displays a table with readings from the system's internal components taken over a period of time.

## System Image Screens
System images display the front view of the server by default. 
If the system model includes a rear view, **Rear** changes the image to the rear view of the system hardware. 
**Front** switches to the front view of the system chassis. 
**Edit Label** displays for system models other than the Mini.

**Edit Label** opens the **Change Enclosure Label** window. 
Type a name or description for the system and click **Save** to apply the label. 
**Reset to Default** restores the default name for the system.

System image screen include two options to change the information on the screen: 
* **Show Pools** that highlights disks in pools on the system image.
* **Show Status** that shows healthy disks in the system and a status indicator color legend.

### Disk Image Screens
Click on a drive image to display a screen with information for that drive. Disk drive information includes the system pool, disk status, hardware details, and stats for the drive.

**Identify Drive** on disk detail screens turns on the LED indicator located on a physical drive bay in the system server. 
This helps to identify the physical drive bay that corresponds to the SCALE identification number for that drive. 
Select the drive on the image and then click **Identify Drive**. Go to the location of the system server to locate the drive bay with the LED indication turned on then check the drive location on the **View Enclosure** screen.
