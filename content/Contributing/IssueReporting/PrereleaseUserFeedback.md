TrueNAS SCALE welcomes community feedback!

To encourage general user experience reporting, nightly or prerelease TrueNAS SCALE versions include the **How would you rate this page?** ![FeedbackIcon](/images/SCALE/Dashboard/FeedbackIcon.png "Feedback Icon") icon.
Some screens undergoing revision also include a **NEW** badge in the header.
