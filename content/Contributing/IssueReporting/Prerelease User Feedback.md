TrueNAS SCALE welcomes community feedback!

To encourage general user experience reporting, prerelease versions of TrueNAS SCALE include the **How would you rate this page?** ![FeedbackIcon](/images/SCALE/23.10/FeedbackIcon.png "Feedback Icon") icon.
Some screens undergoing revision also include a **NEW** badge and **Leave Feedback** link in the header.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/23.10/NewLeaveFeedback.png" alt="NEW Badge and Leave Feedback Link" id="1: NEW Badge and Leave Feedback Link" >}}

Click either the ![FeedbackIcon](/images/SCALE/23.10/FeedbackIcon.png "Feedback Icon") icon or **Leave Feedback** link to open a feedback window that allows you to rate the web UI screen and leave comments.
