TrueCommand API documentation is available from the web interface by opening the user menu and clicking **API**.
Alternately, copy the TrueCommand web interface URL to a new browser tab and append `/api/swagger`.

A static build of this version's API documentation is also provided [here](/api/tc_rest_api.html).
