{{< hint warning >}}

Starting with SCALE Bluefin 22.12.0, *root* account logins are deprecated for security hardening and to comply with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).
All TrueNAS users should [create a local administrator account]({{< relref "/content/SCALE/SCALETutorials/Credentials/ManageLocalUsersSCALE.md" >}}) with all the permissions it requires and begin using it to access TrueNAS.
Starting with SCALE Bluefin 22.12.0, when the root user password is disabled, only an administrative user account can log in to the TrueNAS web interface.
TrueNAS *root* account access will be permanently disabled in a future update.

Enterprise customers should contact iXsystems Support before making any changes to their system.
