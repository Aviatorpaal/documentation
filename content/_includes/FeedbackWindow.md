Use this window to submit a star rating and comments or suggestions for the current page.

{{< hint type=note >}}
The feedback window is used for general user experience feedback. 
Submit bug tickets through the **File Ticket** link that opens the **File Ticket** form, also accessed from the **System Settings > General** screen **File Ticket** button. See [Filing an Issue Ticket in SCALE]({{< relref "fileissuescale.md" >}}) for further instructions.
{{< /hint >}}

The **Take screenshot of the current page** toggle is on by default. When on, TrueNAS SCALE automatically creates and attaches a screenshot.
Turn off the toggle to submit feedback without an image.
When off, the window displays **Attach image (optional)** as an alternative.
Click **Choose File** to attach an existing screenshot.
