{{< hint warning >}}
The root administrator login is deprecated for security hardening, and it might be disabled in future versions of SCALE.

Logging in with the root username and password generates an alert in the UI, instructing you to create an administrative user account. 

As a security best practice and best compatibility with future SCALE version releases, immediately create the new administrative account after signing into SCALE.
