The Documentation Hub has had some changes for the SCALE Bluefin release!

{{< toc >}}

### Table of Contents for Sections with Nested Articles

New functionality allows generating a list of links and showing the article description for articles that are nested within a documentation section.
Articles that have nested content now have a **Table of Contents** expandable or generic subsection that shows links to each article that is within that topic.
Short descriptions of each nested article can also be displayed.

### Related Content Linking

New functionality allows showing a list of links to other articles that have some kind of subject matter relationship.
This is typically used to link Reference content to Tutorials and is generally designed to help readers find related content faster.
