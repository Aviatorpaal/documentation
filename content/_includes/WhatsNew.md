The Documentation Hub has had some changes for the SCALE Bluefin release!

{{< toc >}}

### Updated Actions for Content

The various options to engage with content are reorganized into a more traditional call to action section.
The end of each content article now has a small section that presents options for readers to engage further, either by interacting on the community forums, suggesting content changes, or providing feedback about the current content.

A new low-profile Feedback button is added to the side of the screen.
Clicking the button opens a form for the reader to provide feedback about content or the website.

This gives readers more visibility into opportunities to engage with the wider TrueNAS community.

### Updated Search

The Docs Hub has replaced the existing search algorithm with a lunr.js implementation that conducts keyword searches through the entire content.
Search results display in a separate page.
The full path to each result is visible, along with a description of the content.

### Table of Contents for Sections with Nested Articles

New functionality allows generating a list of links and showing the article description for articles that are nested within a documentation section.
Articles that have nested content now have a **Table of Contents** expandable or generic subsection that shows links to each article that is within that topic.
Short descriptions of each nested article can also be displayed.

### Related Content Linking

New functionality allows showing a list of links to other articles that have some kind of subject matter relationship.
This is typically used to link Reference content to Tutorials and is generally designed to help readers find related content faster.
