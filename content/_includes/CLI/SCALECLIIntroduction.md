Welcome to the TrueNAS SCALE Command Line Interface (CLI) guide!

The **TrueNAS CLI** in TrueNAS SCALE functions like a text-based version of the web UI with many functional areas grouped into parent and child namespaces that mirror the counterparts in the SCALE UI. 

The underlying structure of the CLI namespaces and commands closely follows that of the SCALE API. 
For more information on API commands, arguments, options, and definitions go to **API Keys** and click on **API Docs** in the SCALE UI.
