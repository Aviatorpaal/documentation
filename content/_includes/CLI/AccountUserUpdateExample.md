```
account user update uid_or_username=<value> email="mail@email.com"
```

Where `<value>` is the username or UID of the desired account and `email="mail@email.com"` represents the argument\(s) to be updated.

The command returns a blank line.
To confirm the user is updated, use `account user query` or navigate to [**Credentials > Local Users**]({{< relref "managelocalusersscale.md" >}}) in the SCALE Web UI.
