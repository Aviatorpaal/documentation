The SCALE CLI includes help text for some namespaces and commands through the both the `man`, and `ls` commands. 
To see the basic commands from any namespace, enter `help`.

Use the `man` command to show the help text for a namespace or command with options. 
Type <code>man <i>namespacename</i></code> or <code>man <i>commandname</i></code> to display the help text for that namespace or command.

Use the `ls` command while in a child namespace to view a list of commands and the help text descriptions. 
You can use the `ls` command for some commands that show an autofill list of options to display a list of those options with help text descriptions.

Note, not all namespaces, commands, or commands with options include help text. 

Using `ls` with some commands with autofill options does not always display a list view or help text for the options.
