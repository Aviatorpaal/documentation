<!-- This snippet is intended to embed documentation about the NEW badge and Leave Feedback link in documentation of screens that include them. At present these are the new Apps screen and Pool Create wizard in SCALE 23.10 BETA.1
It also includes the FeedbackWidget snippet, which covers using that screen to submit feedback.-->

To encourage general user experience reporting, some screens undergoing revision in prerelease software versions feature a **NEW** badge and **Leave Feedback** link in the header.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/23.10/NewLeaveFeedback.png" alt="New Badge and Leave Feedback Link" id="1: New Badge and Leave Feedback Link" >}}

The **Leave Feedback** link opens a feedback widget that allows you to rate the web UI screen and leave comments.
