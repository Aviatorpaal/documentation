{{< expand "Alias or Static IP Addresses?" "v" >}}
When do you configure a static IP address? 
Static IP addresses are use to set a fixed address for an interface that external devices or websites need to access or remember, such as for VPN access.

Use aliases to add multiple internal IP address, representing containers or applications hosted in a VM, to an existing network interface without having to define a separate network interface. 

In the UI, you can add aliases when you add an interface or edit an existing interface. Use the **Add** button in the **Static IP Address** widget to add a static IP address.

From the Console setup menu, select option 2 to configure network settings and add alias IP addresses, or option 3 to add a static IP address.
