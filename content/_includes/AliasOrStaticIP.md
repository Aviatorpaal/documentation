{{< expand "One or More Aliases?" "v" >}}
Static IP addresses are used to set a fixed address for an interface that external devices or websites need to access or remember, such as for VPN access.

Use aliases to add multiple internal IP addresses, representing containers or applications hosted in a VM, to an existing network interface without having to define a separate network interface.

In the UI, you can add aliases when you add an interface or edit an existing interface. Use the **Add** button in the **Aliases** widget to add a static IP address. Press **Add** again to add each additional alias.

From the [Console Setup Menu]({{< relref "ConsoleSetupMenuSCALE.md" >}}), select option 1 to configure network settings and add alias IP addresses.
