SCALE Bluefin deprecates and Cobia removes the built-in DDNS, OpenVPN server and client, rsync, S3, and TFTP service. 
The WebDAV service and share feature are also deprecated in Bluefin and removed in Cobia. 
New applications are available in Bluefin to serve as replacements for the functions these services provided.

To migrate from CORE to SCALE Cobia, first upgrade to and migrate from the latest release of CORE to the latest release of SCALE Bluefin (22.12.3.4).  
While running SCALE Bluefin, take the necessary steps to transition from these deprecated services to the applications that replace them, then upgrade to SCALE Cobia (23.10). 
You can install the applications in either Bluefin or Cobia releases.
