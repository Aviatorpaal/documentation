With a stable release, upgrading to SCALE 24.04 (Dragonfish) is primarily done through the web interface [update process]({{< relref "UpdateSCALE.md" >}}).
Another upgrade option is to perform a [fresh install]({{< relref "/SCALE/GettingStarted/Install/_index.md" >}}) on the system and then restore a [system configuration file]({{< relref "ManageSysConfigSCALE.md" >}}).
