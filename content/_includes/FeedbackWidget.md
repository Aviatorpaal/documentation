Use this widget to submit a star rating and comments or suggestions for the current page.

{{< hint type=note >}}
The feedback widget is used for general user experience feedback. Submit bug tickets through the **File Ticket** form. The **File Ticket** link opens the **File Ticket** form that you can also access from the **System Settings > General** screen **File Ticket** button. See [Filing an Issue Ticket in SCALE]({{< relref "fileissuescale.md" >}}) for further instructions.
{{< /hint >}}

If the **Take screenshot of the current page** toggle is on, TrueNAS SCALE automatically creates and attaches a screenshot when feedback is submitted.
This toggle is turned on by default.
Turn off the toggle to submit feedback without an image.
When the toggle is off, the widget also displays the alternative **Attach image (optional)**.
Click **Choose File** to attach an existing screenshot.
