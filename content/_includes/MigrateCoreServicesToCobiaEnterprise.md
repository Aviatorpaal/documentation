SCALE Bluefin deprecates and SCALE Cobia removes the built-in DDNS, OpenVPN server and client, rsync, S3, and TFTP services.
The WebDAV service and share feature are also deprecated in Bluefin and removed in Cobia.
New applications are available in SCALE Bluefin to serve as replacements for the functions provided by these services.

To avoid any potential service outages, Enterprise customers with licensed TrueNAS systems are prevented from upgrading from SCALE 22.12.3 (or later) to SCALE 23.10 unless the deprecated services have been replaced and/or disabled.
Enterprise customers can contact iXsystems Support for assistance migrating from deprecated services.
