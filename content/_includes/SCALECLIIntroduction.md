Welcome to the TrueNAS SCALE Command Line Interface (CLI) guide!

The TrueNAS SCALE CLI functions like a text-based version of the web UI with many functional areas grouped into parent and child namespaces that mirror the same areas in the SCALE UI. 
The underlying CLI structure of namespaces and commands closely follows that of the SCALE API. 
For more information on API commands, options, and arguements go to **API Keys > API Docs** in the SCALE UI.
