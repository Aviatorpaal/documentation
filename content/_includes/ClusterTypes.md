* **Replicated** - Replicate files across bricks in the volume. You can use replicated volumes in environments where high availability and high reliability are critical.
* **Distributed Replicated** - Distribute files across replicated bricks in the volume. You can use distributed replicated volumes in environments where you need to scale storage and high reliability is critical. Distributed replicated volumes also offer improved read performance in most environments. Requires setting an additional **Replica Count**
* **Dispersed** - Dispersed volumes are based on erasure codes, providing space-efficient protection against disk or server failures. It stores an encoded fragment of the original file in each brick so that only a subset of the fragments are needed to recover the original file. When creating the volume, the administrator configures the number of bricks that can be missing without losing access to data. Choosing Dispersed requires setting an additional **Redundancy Count**.
