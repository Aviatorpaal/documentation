Multiple interfaces connected to a single TrueNAS system cannot be members of the same subnet.

You can combine multiple interfaces with Link Aggregation (LAGG) or a Network Bridge.
Alternatively, you can assign multiple static IP addresses to a single interface by configuring aliases.

When multiple Network Interface Cards (NICs) connect to the same subnet, users might incorrectly assume that the interfaces load balance automatically.
However, ethernet network topology allows only one interface to communicate at a time.
Additionally, both interfaces must handle broadcast messages since they are listening on the same network.
This configuration adds complexity and significantly reduces network throughput.

If you require multiple NICs on a single network for performance optimization, you can use a Link Aggregation (LAGG) configured for Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP).
A single LAGG interface with multiple NICs appears as a single connection to the network.

While LACP is beneficial for larger deployments with many active clients, it might not be practical for smaller setups.
It provides additional bandwidth or redundancy for critical networking situations.
However LACP has limitations as it does not load balance packets.

On the other hand, if you need multiple IP addresses on a single subnet, you can configure one or more static IP aliases for a single NIC.

In summary, it is recommended to use LACP if you need multiple interfaces on a network.
If you need multiple IP addresses, you can define aliases. Deviation from these practices might result in unexpected behavior.
