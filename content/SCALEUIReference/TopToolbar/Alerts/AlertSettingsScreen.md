## Alert Warning Levels

Use the **Set Warning Level** dropdown list to customize alert importance. Each warning level has an icon and color to express the level of urgency.

To make the system email you when alerts with a specific warning level trigger, set up an email alert service with that warning level. 

{{< truetable >}}
| Level | Icon | Alert Notification? |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| **INFO** | ![AlertLevelInfoNoticeAlertEmergency](/images/SCALE/AlertLevelInfoNoticeAlertEmergency.png "Alert Levels") | No |
| **NOTICE** | ![AlertLevelInfoNoticeAlertEmergency](/images/SCALE/AlertLevelInfoNoticeAlertEmergency.png "Alert Levels") | Yes |
| **WARNING** | ![AlertLevelWarning](/images/SCALE/AlertLevelWarning.png "Alert Levels") | Yes |
| **ERROR** | ![AlertLevelErrorCritical](/images/SCALE/AlertLevelErrorCritical.png "Alert Levels") | Yes |
| **CRITICAL** | ![AlertLevelErrorCritical](/images/SCALE/AlertLevelErrorCritical.png "Alert Levels") | Yes |

## Alert Frequency

Use the **Set Frequency** dropdown list to adjust how often the system sends or displays alert notifications. 

Alert frequency options are **Immediately (Default)**, **Hourly**, **Daily** or **Never**. Setting the **Frequency** to **Never** prevents that alert from displaying in the **Alerts Notification** dialog, but it still pops up in the web UI if triggered.
