## To Download this Release

Login to the [TrueCommand Account Portal](https://portal.ixsystems.com) for downloads, documentation links, and licensing options.
For storage clusters with more than 50 disks, the account portal also offers a *free 60-day trial license with unlimited disks*.

#### Minimum Supported TrueNAS Versions

Due to the changes in integrating with the TrueNAS middleware, the minimum version for full-support of functionality has changed with TrueCommand 2.1:

* FreeNAS/TrueNAS 11.3 series - No longer supported. Does not provide realtime statistics or storage information, but you can still connect to them and use TrueCommand to initiate updates.
* TrueNAS 12 CORE/Enterprise - Supported after 12.0-U3. 12.0-U2.1 and older are missing some key metrics in the realtime stats (disk/network usage metrics in particular), but work otherwise.
* TrueNAS SCALE 21.03+ - Fully Supported (SCALE-20.12+ is supported excluding cluster functionality)
 
## To Update to this Release

{{< hint info >}}
**Prior To Updating**
 
As a best practice, TrueCommand admins should backup their instance's data directory before deploying TrueCommand updates. If issues arise after updating, admins can simply pull the previous TC docker image and redeploy with their previous data directory.

{{< hint warning >}}
**Important Note for Upgrading from v1.3**
 
Updating from TrueCommand v1.3 to v2.0 or higher involves a database migration process. This preserves all configuration data, but does not preserve old performance statistics.
Additionally, it is not possible to roll back to TrueCommand v1.3 from v2.1. Please use caution when upgrading production TrueCommand systems. If necessary, run TrueCommand 1.3 and TrueCommand 2.1 in parallel for a transition period. Simply use the "ixsystems/truecommand:1.3.2" docker image to continue using that specific version of TrueCommand.
{{< /hint >}}
 
**Docker:** Re-run `docker pull ixsystems/truecommand` to fetch the latest version of TrueCommand, and then restart your docker instance.

**VM Image:** Either reboot the VM or run `systemctl restart truecommand.service`.
This will automatically fetch and start the latest Docker image of TrueCommand within your VM.
