Due to changes in California law with [SB-327](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327), the way IPMI logins are handled has changed on iXsystems hardware.

#### Prior to SB-327

The username/password default credentials are:
```
Username: Admin
Password: Admin
```

#### After SB-327

The username is `Admin`.
The random password is listed in the Basic Setup Guide you received with your unit as well as on a sticker on the back of your system.  If for some reason you have lost these or the sticker is not legible anymore, contact iXsystems Support for assistance.
