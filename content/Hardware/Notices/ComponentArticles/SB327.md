Due to changes in California law with [SB-327](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327), the way iXsystems hardware uses IPMI credentials has changed.

## Randomized Passwords (SB-327 Compliant)

* The username is `ADMIN`.
* X-Series systems use `admin`.

The randomized password is printed on a sticker and placed on the purchased system (typically on the back).
Customers purchasing Enterprise-level hardware can also find the password on the Asset List included with their shipment.
If neither location has this password, please contact iXsystems Support.

## Prior to SB-327

{{< hint info >}}
The previous default credentials can vary by system "family".
They are listed here as a historical reference for customers that received a system prior to SB-327 implementation.

TrueNAS Mini models, including the discontinued E+, used these default credentials:

**Mini E+, X+, and XL+:**

* Username: `ADMIN`

2. IPMI connections using `ipmitool`:
   * Username: `admin`
   * Password: `admin`

These credentials applied to both generations of M-Series systems and each model (M40, M50, and M60):

* Username: `ADMIN`
* Password: `ADMIN`

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "R-Series" >}}
