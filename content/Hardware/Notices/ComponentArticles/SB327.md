Due to changes in California law with [SB-327](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327), the way iXsystems hardware uses IPMI credentials has changed.

### Prior to SB-327

The default credentials are:
```
Username: Admin
Password: Admin
```

### After SB-327

The username is `Admin`.
The random password is listed in the Basic Setup Guide included with the purchased TrueNAS Hardware and on a sticker applied to the back of the system.
If neither location has this password, contact iXsystems Support.
