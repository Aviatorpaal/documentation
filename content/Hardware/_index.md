TrueNAS Minis allow you to easily store and manage your important data using any storage protocol, including NFS, SMB, AFP, iSCSI, S3, and many others.
All Minis are backed by the OpenZFS (ZFS) enterprise-class file system that provides software RAID to protect your data from drive failure, data corruption, file deletion, and even malware attacks.

TrueNAS Minis are built with professional-grade components including ECC RAM and IPMI for remote management. Whisper-quiet fans and low power footprints make them ideal for a quiet office environment.
