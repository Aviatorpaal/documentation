iXsystems released TrueCommand 2.3.0 on January 25, 2023.
This version received its final update on June 20, 2023.
The terminal version of TrueCommand 2.3 is 2.3.3.

TrueCommand is a multi-system management application that helps control and monitor your TrueNAS fleet.
TrueCommand assists in managing TrueNAS systems through REST APIs, WebSocket APIs, and a web user interface.
The TrueCommand web interface provides single sign-on functionality and unified administration of users and TrueNAS systems.

TrueCommand can monitor an entire fleet of TrueNAS systems and thousands of online storage devices simultaneously.
This includes displaying statistics on storage usage, network activity, active services, and more.
TrueCommand also has the ability to create custom reports about individual systems or a combination of many systems.
