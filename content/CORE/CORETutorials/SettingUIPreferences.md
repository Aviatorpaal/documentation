## Tuning the Visibility of UI Elements.

If you want to change the color appearance of the web interface, you can open the **Choose Theme** drop down and select from a range of prebuilt or any custom created themes.
The **High Contrast** option offers the most visibility

If your screen space is limited, set **Prefer buttons with icons only** to only display icons and tooltips without text labels.

For increased security, you can unset the **Enable Password Toggle** checkbox.
This removes all the <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Visibility">visibility</i> icons next to password fields and prevents the actual password characters from being visible.

## Creating a Custom Theme

If one of the included themes doesn't satisfy your preference, a fully custom theme can be created.
Click **CREATE NEW THEME** to start configuring the theme.

1. Open **Load colors from existing theme** and select an existing theme to import into the configuration.
   This is useful when you have an existing theme you like but want to change a couple of colors within it.
2. Click the **COLORS** tab and define the color values you want to use for this new theme.
   You can either type in RGBA or hexadecimal color values or click a color swatch to open a visual color picker.
   The **Preview** updates to reflect your current choices. If you want to turn this off and compare with the currently active theme, click the **PREVIEW** tab and toggle **Global Preview**.
3. Go to the **GENERAL** tab and choose the primary, accent, and topbar colors for the theme. These options are based off the color selections you made in the **COLORS** tab.
4. Name and label the theme and click **SUBMIT** to save it and add it to the options on the **Preferences** page.
