Resilvering, or the process of copying data to a replacement disk, is best completed as quickly as possible.
Increasing the priority of resilvers helps them finish faster.
The **Resilver Priority** menu allows scheduling when a resilver can become a higher priority for the system.
This means scheduling resilvers when the additional I/O or CPU use does not affect normal usage.

Go to **Tasks > Resilver Priority** to configure the priority to a time that most effective for your environment.
