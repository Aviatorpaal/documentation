NIS ([Network Information Service](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-unix-and/0596003234/ch14s01.html)) is a clientâ€“server directory service protocol for distributing system configuration data such as user and host names between computers on a computer network.

{{< expand "What exactly does this do?" "v" >}}
A NIS system maintains and distributes a central directory of user and group information, hostnames, e-mail aliases and other text-based tables of information in a computer network.
In FreeBSD, the list of users is placed in <file>/etc/passwd</file> and authentication hashes in <file>/etc/shadow</file>.
NIS adds another "global" user list to identify users on any NIS domain client.

{{< hint warning >}}
NIS is limited in scalability and security.
For modern networks, [LDAP](/core/directoryservices/ldap/) has replaced NIS.

To configure NIS, go to **Directory Services > NIS**.

![DirectoryServicesNIS](/images/CORE/12.0/DirectoryServicesNIS.png)

Enter the *NIS Domain* name and list any *NIS Servers* (hostnames or IP addresses).
Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to separate server entries.
Configure the remaining options as needed:

* *Secure Mode* : Set to have [ypbind(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ypbind) refuse to bind to any NIS server not running as *root* on a TCP port over *1024*.
* *Manycast* : Set for `ypbind` to bind to the fastest responding server.
* *Enable* : Unset to disable the configuration without deleting it.

When ready, *SAVE* the configuration.
