**TrueNAS CORE** is free and Open Source and is the successor to the wildly popular FreeNAS.
It runs on virtually any x86_64 system and provides a broad set of features for many users.
Plugin applications like Plex, NextCloud, and Asigra allow the functionality of a system to be customized for many use cases.
