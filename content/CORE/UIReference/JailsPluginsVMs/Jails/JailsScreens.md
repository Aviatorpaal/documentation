{{< truetable >}}
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **EDIT** | Used to modify the settings described in **Advanced Jail Creation** below. You cannot edit a jail while it is running. You can only view the settings that are read only until you stop the jail operation. |
| **MOUNT POINTS** | Select an existing mount point to edit. Either click **EDIT** or click **ACTIONS** > **Add Mount Point** to create a mount point for the jail. A mount point gives a jail access to storage located elsewhere on the system. You must stop a jail before adding, editing, or deleting a mount point. See Additional Storage for more details. |
| **RESTART** | Stops and immediately starts a jail that is running or **up**. |
| **START** | Starts a jail that has a current **STATE** of **down**. |
| **STOP** | Stops a jail that has a current **STATE** of **up**. |
| **UPDATE** | Runs [freebsd-update](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update) to update the jail to the latest patch level of the installed FreeBSD release. |
| **> SHELL** | Displays the **Shell** screen which provides access to a *root* command prompt where you can interact with a jail directly from the command line. Type `exit` to leave the command prompt and display the **Jails** screen. |
| **DELETE** | Deletes the selected jail. Caution: deleting the jail also deletes all of the jail contents and all associated snapshots. Back up the jail data, configuration, and programs first. There is no way to recover the contents of a jail after deleting it! |

{{< hint type=note >}}
Action options change based on the jail state. For example, a stopped jail does not have a **STOP** or **> SHELL** option.

## Jail Creation Options
TrueNAS has two options to create a jail, the **Wizard** and **Advanced Jail Creation** screens.
The Jail **Wizard** makes it easy to create a jail.
**ADVANCED JAIL CREATION** opens the advanced configuration screens with all possible configuration settings. This form is recommended only for advanced users with very specific requirements for a jail.

{{< expand "Jail Wizard" "v" >}}
Use the jail-creation **Wizard** to add a new jail by following and completing required fields in a pre-determimed order. The wizard provides the simplest process to create and configure a new jail.
Click **ADD** to display the first of three Wizard configuration screens.

### Wizard Navigation

Use **Next** to advance to the next screen.
Use **Back** to return to the previous screen.
Use **SUBMIT** to save all settings and create the Jail.
Use **Cancel** to close the current screen exit the configuration process without saving.

![JailsWizardNameJailChooseFreeBSDRelease](/images/CORE/Jails/JailsWizardNameJailChooseFreeBSDRelease.png "Jails Wizard NameJail Choose FreeBSD Release")

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Required field. Enter a name that can include letters, numbers, periods (.), dashes (-), and underscores (_). |
| **Jail Type** | Select an option from the dropdown list. Options are **Default (Clone Jail)** or **Basejail**. Use **Default (Clone Jail)** to clone jails that are clones of the specified value in **Release**. They are linked to that release, even if they are upgraded. Use **Basejails** to mount the specified release directories as nullfs mounts over the jail directories. Basejails are not linked to the original release when upgraded. Versions of FreeBSD are downloaded the first time they are used in a jail. Additional jails created with the same version of FreeBSD are created faster because the download is already complete. |
| **Release** | Select an option from the dropdown list. Options are **12.2-RELEASE** or **13.0-RELEASE**. This is the FreeBSD release to use as the jail operating system. Jails can run FreeBSD versions up to the same version as the host system. Newer releases are not shown. |
| **Advanced Jail Creation** | Opens the **Advanced Jail Creation** screens. This form is recommended only for advanced users with very specific requirements for a jail |
