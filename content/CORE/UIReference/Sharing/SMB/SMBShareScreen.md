## Advanced Options

![SharingSMBAdvancedOptions](/images/CORE/13.0/SharingSMBAdvancedOptions.png "SMB Share Advanced Options")

Options are divided into **Access** and **Other Options** groups.
**Access** options control various settings for allowing systems or users to access or modify the shared data.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable ACL** | Select to add Access Control List (ACL) support to the share. Leaving checkbox cleared disables ACL support and deletes any existing ACL for the share. |
| **Export Read Only** | Select to prohibit writes to the share. Leave checkbox clear allows writes to the share. |
| **Browsable to Network Clients** | Select to determine whether this share name is included when browsing shares. Home shares are only visible to the owner regardless of this setting. |
| **Allow Guest Access** | Select to make privileges the same as the guest account. Guest access is disabled by default in Windows 10 version 1709 and Windows Server version 1903. Additional client-side configuration is required to provide guest access to these clients.<br><br> **MacOS clients**: Attempting to connect as a user that does not exist in FreeNAS *does not* automatically connect as the guest account. The **Connect As: Guest** option must be specifically chosen in MacOS to log in as the guest account. See the [Apple documentation](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/connect-mac-shared-computers-servers-mchlp1140/mac) for more details. |
| **Access Based Share Enumeration** | checkbox | Select to restrict share visibility to users with read or write access to the share. See the [smb.conf](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smb.conf.5.html) manual page. |
| **Hosts Allow** | Enter a list of allowed host names or IP addresses. Separate entries by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. A more detailed description with examples see [here](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smb.conf.5.html#HOSTSALLOW).
| **Hosts Deny** | Enter a list of denied host names or IP addresses. Separate entries by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. |

{{< expand "Host Allow and Hosts Deny Fields" >}}
The **Hosts Allow** and **Hosts Deny** fields work together to produce different situations:
* If neither **Hosts Allow** or **Hosts Deny** contain an entry, then SMB share access is allowed for any host.
* If there is an entry in **Hosts Allow** list but none in **Hosts Deny** list, then only allow hosts on the **Hosts Allow** list.
* If there is an entry in **Hosts Deny** list but none in **Hosts Allow** list, then allow all hosts that are not on the **Hosts Deny** list.
* If there are both an entry in **Hosts Allow** and **Hosts Deny** list, then allow all hosts that are on the **Hosts Allow** list. If there is a host not on the **Hosts Allow** and not on the **Hosts Deny** list, then allow it.
{{< /expand >}}

The **Other Options** have settings for improving Apple software compatibility, ZFS snapshot features, and other advanced features.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Use as Home Share** | Select to allow the share to host user home directories. Each user is given a personal home directory when connecting to the share which is not accessible by other users. This allows for a personal, dynamic share. Only one share can be used as the home share. See the configuring [Home Share article]({{< relref "/CORE/CORETutorials/Sharing/HomeShare.md" >}}) for detailed instructions. |
| **Time Machine** | Select to enable [Apple Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) backups on this share. |
| **Enable Shadow Copies** | Select to allow export ZFS snapshots as [Shadow Copies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/vss/shadow-copies-and-shadow-copy-sets) for Microsoft Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) clients. |
| **Export Recycle Bin** | Select to allow files that are deleted from the same dataset to moved to the Recycle Bin and not take any additional space. Deleting files over NFS removes the files permanently! When the files are in a different dataset or a child dataset, they are copied to the dataset where the Recycle Bin is located. To prevent excessive space usage, files larger than 20 MiB are deleted rather than moved. Adjust the **Auxiliary Parameter** `crossrename:sizelimit=` setting to allow larger files. For example, <code>crossrename:sizelimit=<i>50</i></code> allows moves of files up to 50 MiB in size. This means files can be permanently deleted or moved from the recycle bin. This is not a replacement for ZFS snapshots! |
| **Use Apple-style Character Encoding** | Select to enable this option converts NTFS illegal characters in the same manner as MacOS SMB clients. By default, Samba uses a hashing algorithm for NTFS illegal characters. |
| **Enable Alternate Data Streams** | Select to allow multiple [NTFS data streams](https://www.ntfs.com/ntfs-multiple.htm). Leave checkbox clear and this option causes MacOS to write streams to files on the file system. |
| **Enable SMB2/3 Durable Handles** | Select to allow using open file handles that can withstand short disconnections. Support for POSIX byte-range locks in Samba is also disabled. This option is not recommended when configuring multi-protocol or local access to files. |
| **Enable FSRVP** | Select to enable support for the File Server Remote VSS Protocol ([FSVRP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fsrvp/dae107ec-8198-4778-a950-faa7edad125b)). This protocol allows Remote Procedure Call (RPC) clients to manage snapshots for a specific SMB share. The share path must be a dataset mountpoint. Snapshots have the prefix `fss-` followed by a snapshot creation timestamp. A snapshot must have this prefix for an RPC user to delete it. |
| **Path Suffix** | Appends a suffix to the share connection path. This provides unique shares on a per-user, per-computer, or per-IP address basis. Suffixes can contain a macro. See the [smb.conf](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smb.conf.5.html) manual page for a list of supported macros. The connectpath must be preset before a client connects. |
| **Auxiliary Parameters** | Additional [smb.conf](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smb.conf.5.html) settings. |

Use **Submit** to save setings, create the share and add it to the **Sharing > Windows Shares (SMB)** list.
