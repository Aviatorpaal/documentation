The alert system provides a visual warning when system conditions require administrative attention.
The alert icon in the upper right corner has a notification badge that displays the total number of unread alerts.

Alert icons indicate notification, warning, critical, and one-shot critical alerts. Critical messages are also emailed to the root account. One-shot critical alerts must be dismissed by the user.
