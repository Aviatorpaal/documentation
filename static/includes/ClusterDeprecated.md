TrueCommand 3.0 has not passed validation for Clustering and that feature is expected to be highly unstable in this release.
With the current unmaintained state of the upstream Gluster project, consider this functionality deprecated.
The clustering feature is scheduled for removal in a future TrueCommand revision.

Further, TrueNAS SCALE 24.04 has removed the deprecated gluster backend.
Systems installed with SCALE 24.04 (Dragonfish) are unable to use this deprecated TrueCommand feature.
