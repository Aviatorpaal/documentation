SCALE 24.04 changes the default user home directory location from **/nonexistent** to **/var/empty**.
This new directory is an immutable directory shared by service accounts and accounts that should not have a full home directory.

Existing users with an SMB Home Share who upgrade to 24.04 can experience disruptions to the following services:

* SMB shares
* SSH
* Shell access

Users with an SMB Home Share should review local user accounts for any with home directories set to **/nonexistent**.
Update the home directory path to **/var/empty** for all affected accounts.
Accounts with an existing home directory other than **/nonexistent** do not need to be modified.
