SCALE 24.04 changes the default user home directory location from **/nonexistent** to **/var/empty**.
This new directory is an immutable directory shared by service accounts and accounts that should not have a full home directory.

The 24.04.01 maintenance release introduces automated migration to force home directories of existing SMB users from **/nonexistent** to **/var/empty**.
