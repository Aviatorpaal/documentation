Although TrueNAS attempts to keep most of your CORE configuration data when upgrading to SCALE, some CORE-specific items do not transfer.
These are the items that do not migrate from CORE:

* Microsoft OneDrive Cloud Sync credentials and tasks. OneDrive compatibility is not available in TrueNAS SCALE.
* FreeBSD GELI encryption.
  If you have GELI-encrypted pools on your system that you plan to import into SCALE, you must migrate your data from the GELI pool to a non-GELI encrypted pool *before* migrating to SCALE.
* Malformed certificates.
  TrueNAS SCALE validates the system certificates when a CORE system migrates to SCALE.
  When a malformed certificate is found, SCALE generates a new self-signed certificate to ensure system accessibility.
* CORE plugins and jails. Save the configuration information for your plugin and back up any stored data.
  After completing the SCALE install, add the equivalent SCALE application using the **Apps** option.
  If your CORE plugin is not listed as an available application in SCALE, use the **Launch Docker Image** option to add it as an application and import data from the backup into a new SCALE dataset for the application.
* NIS data.
* System tunables.
* ZFS boot environments.
* SMB auxiliary parameters.
  As of SCALE 23.10 (Cobia), the **Auxiliary Parameters** option is no longer available in the UI as a configurable option.
  We recommend removing any auxiliary parameter settings in CORE before migrating to SCALE.
* AFP shares also do not transfer, but migrate into an SMB share with AFP compatibility enabled.
* CORE `netcli` utility. A new CLI utility is used for the [Console Setup Menu]({{< relref "ConsoleSetupMenuSCALE.md" >}}) and other commands issued in a CLI.
  By default, any TrueNAS user account with **netcli** as the chosen **Shell** updates to use the **nologin** option instead. See the [Users Screens]({{< relref "LocalUsersScreensSCALE.md#authentication-settings" >}}) reference article for descriptions of all **Shell** options.
* SAS multipath is not supported in TrueNAS SCALE.
* TrueNAS CORE account names beginning with a number are not supported in TrueNAS SCALE.
  Usernames in SCALE must begin with a letter or an underscore.
  Before attempting a CORE to SCALE migration, review the local user accounts and rename or replace any accounts that begin with a numeric character (`0`-`9`).

VM storage and its basic configuration transfer over during a migration, but you need to double-check the VM configuration and the network interface settings specifically before starting the VM.

Init/shutdown scripts transfer, but can break. Review them before use.
