Application maintenance is independent from TrueNAS SCALE version release cycles.
App versions, features, configuration options, and installation behavior at the time of access might vary from those in documented tutorials.
All application tutorials are no longer linked to individual major SCALE releases such as 23.10 or 24.04.
To make locating instructions easier, app tutorials are now only found in the SCALE Nightly branch.
