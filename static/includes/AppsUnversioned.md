Application maintenance is independent from TrueNAS SCALE version release cycles.
This means app version information, features, configuration options, and installation behavior at the time of access might vary from those in documented tutorials.

All application articles are no longer associated with individual major SCALE releases such as 23.10 or 24.04, and are now only found in the SCALE Nightly branch of the Documenation Hub.
