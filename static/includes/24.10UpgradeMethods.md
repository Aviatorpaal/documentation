With a stable release, upgrading to SCALE 24.10 (Electric Eel) from an earlier SCALE release is primarily done using a SCALE **.iso** file to perform a [fresh install]({{< relref "/SCALE/GettingStarted/Install/_index.md" >}}) on the system and then restore a [system configuration file]({{< relref "ManageSysConfigSCALE.md" >}}).
