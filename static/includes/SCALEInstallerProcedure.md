4. Select option **1 Administrative user (admin)** then **OK** to install SCALE and create the admin user account and password.
   SCALE has implemented the administrator login as a replacement for the root user login as a security hardening measure.
   The system retains root as a fallback but it is no longer the default.
   The admin account has full control over TrueNAS and is used to log in to the web interface.
   Set a strong password and protect it.

   We do not recommend selecting **3 Configure using Web UI**.
