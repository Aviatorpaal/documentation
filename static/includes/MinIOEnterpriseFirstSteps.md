If the system has active sharing configurations (SMB, NFS, iSCSI), disable these sharing services in **System > Services** before adding and configuring the MinIO application.
Start any sharing services after MinIO completes the install and starts.

Multi mode configurations require a self-signed certificate. If creating a cluster each system requires a self-signed certificate.

{{< include file="/static/includes/AddAppCertificate.md" >}} Add a self-signed certificate for the MinIO application to use.

Create four datasets named, data1, data2, data3, and data4. 
Do not nest these datasets under each other. Select the parent dataset, for example *apps*, before you click **Create Dataset**.
Set the **Share Type** to **apps** for each dataset. 
MinIO assigns the correct properties during the installation process so you do not need to configure the ACL or permissions.
